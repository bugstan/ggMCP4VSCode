  - **📂 File Operations**: Read, write, create, and patch files safely.
  - **💻 Terminal Control**: Execute commands, run background tasks, and capture output.
  - **🔧 Git Integration**: Commit, push, pull, view diffs, and manage branches.
  - **🐛 Debugging**: Set breakpoints and manage launch configurations.
  - **🔍 Code Analysis**: Find symbols, references, and definitions.
- **Secure Architecture**: Localhost-only binding ensuring your code stays private on your machine.
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamless support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Extension

- Search for "GG MCP for VSCode" in the VS Code marketplace and install
- Or [click here to install](vscode:extension/bugstan.gg-mcp-for-vscode)

### 2. Recommended Setup

- **Claude Desktop Integration**: This extension is fully compatible with Claude Desktop, allowing you to:
  - Accept and execute development instructions from Claude
  - Enable automated coding assistance through Claude's AI capabilities
  - Let Claude read and modify your codebase directly with proper permissions
- **MCPxHub**: For enhanced experience, use with [MCPxHub](https://github.com/bugstan/MCPxHub) plugin

### 3. Verify Server Is Running

After installation, the MCP server automatically starts. Check the bottom-right status bar:
